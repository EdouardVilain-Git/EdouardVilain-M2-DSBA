- **Duration:** 1 week.
- **Group Size:** 5.
- **Project Description:** A Data Challenge organized by BCG Gamma on driver delivery scheduling. We were asked for two deliverables:
  - a predictive model for Parisian traffic density using public data.
  - a strategy to organize a delivery company's driver schedule according to our model's results.
- **Final Result:** We built a simple Catboost model with heavy feature engineering. Model performed extremely well when including environmental features such as weather, temperature and covid restrictions state.
- **Ranking:** 1st Place.
