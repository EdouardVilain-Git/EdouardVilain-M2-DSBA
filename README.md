## Introduction

A collection of the Data Science related projects of my final Master's year. This repo showcases works across Data Science related fields such as Querying, Engineering, Processing and Visualizing. 

The aim is to summarize the work I have achieved during this final Master's year and does not aim to be copied, except for personal use. By respect for the several third party authors involved in each of the projects, I have intentionally left project files aside, so code could not be run directly from the Git. Please contact me if you wish to work on a project in particular.

## Project Summaries

Here is a short summary of the projects showcased in this repo.

### 1. BCG Gamma Data Challenge - Predicting Parisian Road Traffic for Delivery Scheduling

BCG Gamma challenged us, by teams of 5, to a one week Data Challenge. We combined both technical skills and business savviness to solve a real-world business case on delivery driver scheduling. We were asked for two deliverables: 1) a model that predicted future Parisian road traffic, 2) a strategy to organize driver deliveries according to our model's results.
