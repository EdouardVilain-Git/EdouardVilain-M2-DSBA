# Edouard Vilain - M2 in Data Sciences & Business Analytics

## Introduction

This repo is a collection of the Data Science related projects of my final Master's year. It showcases works across Data Science related fields such as Querying, Engineering, Processing and Visualizing. 

The aim is to summarize the work I have achieved during this final Master's year and does not aim to be copied, except for personal use. By respect for the several third party authors involved in each of the projects, I have intentionally left project files aside, so code could not be run directly from the Git. Please contact me if you wish to work on a project in particular.

## Project Summaries

Here is a short summary of the projects showcased in this repo.

## I- Company Projects and Challenges

### 1. BCG Gamma Data Challenge - Predicting Parisian Road Traffic for Delivery Scheduling

BCG Gamma challenged us, by teams of 5, to a one week Data Challenge. We were asked to combine both technical skills and business savviness to solve a real-world business case on delivery driver scheduling. We were asked for two deliverables: 1) a model that predicted future Parisian road traffic, 2) a strategy to organize driver deliveries according to our model's results. **Our group won the Data Challenge** finishing first in both categories.
Our technical approach was based on exhaustive feature engineering and a simple CatBoost model. We included features such as weather state and covid restrictions which led us to considerably precise results. In fine, our strategy combined a sharp analysis of our results and concrete, real-world insightfulness.

### 2. Eleven Strategy Hackathon - Worksite Monitoring

We were challenged by Eleven Strategy to ensure worksite safety utilizing Computer Vision technology. With annotated worksite images, we trained a worker detection model and produced a real-time, reporting tool. The model was transfer learned on a pre-trained version of Facebook's Detectron. It produced precise results which were extremely satisfying from a practical stand-point. These results were then reported to security in real-time using a Streamlit interface. Moreover, alerts would be sent when workers were identified in unsual zones of the worksites. **Our group finished second** of the Hackathon.
